          </div>
          <p class="lead">How's My SSL? is a cute little website that
            tells you how secure your <a href="#tls-vs-ssl">TLS
            client</a> is. TLS clients just like the browser you're
            reading this with.</p>

          <p>How's My SSL? was originally made to help a web server
            developer learn what real world TLS clients were capable
            of. It's been expanded to give developers and the very
            technically-savvy a quick and easy way to learn more about
            the TLS tools they use.</p>

          <p>It's also meant to impel developers to modernize and
            improve their TLS stacks. Many security problems come from
            engineers simply not knowing what worries to have. How's My
            SSL? is a demonstration of what those TLS client worries
            should be.</p>

          <p>How's My SSL? chooses topics important to today's security
            environment and analyzes clients in that context. It will
            never be a complete audit, but it can hit the high
            notes. Over time, How's My SSL? will change to live in an
            ever more difficult security environment. It will be kept up
            by <a href="#contributing">people who care</a>.</p>

          <hr />

          <h3 class="fragpadded" id="rating">Rating</h3>
          <p>How's My SSL? gives a rating to each client that connects to
            it. These ratings are not the final word on "how secure" a TLS
            client is, but captures important aspects of its security.</p>

          <p>Clients are rated as <span class="label okay">Probably Okay</span> if no security problems could
            be detected.</p>

          <p>Clients are downgraded
            to <span class="label improvable">Improvable</span> if they do not support
            ephemeral key cipher suites, do not support session tickets, or are
            using TLS 1.1.</p>
          <p>Clients are downgraded to <span class="label bad">Bad</span> if any of
            the following are true:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>It uses TLS 1.0 (instead of 1.1 or 1.2), or, worse, SSLv3 or
              earlier.</li>
            <li>It supports known insecure cipher suites. Developers can find
              the list of known insecure cipher suites in
              the <a href="https://github.com/jmhodges/howsmyssl/blob/master/insecure_suites.go">howsmyssl
              repository</a> on GitHub.</li>
            <li>It supports TLS compression (that is compression of the
              encryption information used to secure your connection) which
              exposes it to the
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRIME_(security_exploit)">CRIME
                attack</a>.</li>
            <li>It is susceptible to the
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#BEAST_attack">BEAST
                attack</a>.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>How's My SSL? always selects the worst rating the client could
            receive.  That is, clients rated as "Bad" may also have problems
            that, on their own, would have rated them as "Improvable".</p>

          <hr />

          <h3 class="fragpadded" id="what-it-means">What It Means</h3>
          <p>How's My SSL has a lot of jargon on it. We're going to discuss the
            sections on its homepage. While it won't help everyone understand all
            of it, those who have a glimmer of an idea of what they mean will be
            better off reading these.</p>

          <h4 class="fragpadded" id="version">Version</h4>
          <p>The Version section discusses the security of the highest version
            of the TLS protocol your client supports. (Formerly, TLS
            was <a href="#tls-vs-ssl">known as "SSL"</a>.)</p>
          <p>TLS 1.3 and 1.2 are the most recent versions of TLS and they're recommended for clients
            to implement. They're the new normal for highly secure websites. TLS
            1.2 provides access to advanced cipher suites that support
            elliptical curve cryptography (large efficiency wins) and AEAD block
            cipher modes (like the very nice GCM cipher suites). TLS 1.3 adds those 
            features plus downgrade attack prevention, improved latency, support for more modern elliptical curves, 
            and all of TLS 1.3 connections are forward secret.
            Clients using TLS 1.3 and 1.2 may be set to <span class="label okay">Probably Okay</span>.</p>
          <p>TLS 1.1 is the third most recent version of TLS. It fixes some
            security problems in TLS 1.0, removing the need for many of the
            workarounds built into clients and servers. Many deployed clients
            and servers of TLS 1.0 do not implement those workarounds and, so,
            TLS 1.1 is a good improvement. However, the modern security
            environment has pushed us to TLS 1.3. Clients using TLS 1.1 will be
            marked down to at least
            <span class="label improvable">Improvable</span>.</p>
          <p>TLS 1.0 is the first version of TLS, is fairly common in the world,
            and requires workarounds in both the client and server to work
            securely for all cipher suites. TLS 1.0 is also unable to use modern
            cipher suites that offer greater security and efficiency. Clients
            using it will be marked as <span class="label bad">Bad</span>.</p>
          <p>SSLv3, the last version of SSL, and the first before TLS 1.0, is
            considered insecure. Clients using it or older versions of SSL will
            be marked as <span class="label bad">Bad</span>.</p>

          <h4 class="fragpadded" id="ephemeral-key-support">Ephemeral Key Support</h4>
          <p>The Ephemeral Key Support section says if your client tells
            the service that it supports cipher suites that include an
            additional private key created for each connection to the
            service. This allows servers that support it to
            provide <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_secrecy">forward
            secrecy</a> to the client.</p>
          <p>This extra key prevents attackers from storing all of
            your encrypted communication with the website, then later
            gaining access to the website's private key, and decrypting
            all of your (and others') traffic to the website. This
            additional key, however, is expensive to transfer,
            especially without elliptical curve cryptography support in
            the client and server to make the key smaller at the same
            security. Clients with support for ephemeral key cipher
            suites will be defaulted to <span class="label
                                                     okay">Probably Okay</span>. Clients without it will be
            marked as <span class="label bad">Bad</span>.</p>

          <h4 class="fragpadded" id="session-ticket-support">Session Ticket Support</h4>
          <p>Session tickets are a mechanism to speed up resumption of encrypted
            communication with a server. When a client and server first connect
            over TLS, they perform a complicated, time-consuming handshake. This
            handshake lets the client and the server communicate a shared secret
            (basically, a password) without exposing that secret to people
            tapping the line. However, it only allows the client and the
            specific computer that served the client communicate. Since websites
            can (and, often, must) serve their traffic from many physical
            computers, if the client disconnects and reconnects to the website,
            the client could connect to another machine that knew nothing about
            the shared secret. When that happens, the client and server have to
            perform the slow handshake again.</p>
          <p>If the client supports session tickets, the physical machines that
            serve a website's traffic and share a special second key called a
            session ticket key can deterministically generate a secret shared
            with the client called a session ticket. If the client connects and
            reconnects it includes this session ticket and most of the expensive
            reconnection process can be skipped. This is a huge performance
            boost, making users happier.</p>
          <p>However, the session ticket key living on all of the website's
            computers means there is a secret that could be leaked to an
            attacker. Worse, it undermines the security
            of <a href="#ephemeral-key-support">ephemeral key cipher
            suites</a>. Preventing this is often a source
            of <a href="https://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2011/11/protecting-data-for-long-term-with.html">important</a>
            <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2013/forward-secrecy-at-twitter-0">engineering</a>
            <a href="https://www.imperialviolet.org/2013/06/27/botchingpfs.html">work</a>
            for a security engineer team. Of course, another alternative is for
            the website to simply turn off support for session tickets and
            enable support for ephemeral keys.</p>
          <p>How's My SSL will rate clients with session ticket
            support as <span class="label okay">Probably Okay</span>,
            but not having it will only have it defaulted to
            <span class="label improvable">Improvable</span>.</p>

          <h4 class="fragpadded" id="tls-compression">TLS Compression</h4>
          <p>TLS compression was a specification of a way to make the data in
            the encrypted connection smaller in order to speed up the transfer
            of data across those connections. Unfortunately, applying this
            technique makes it easy for attackers to learn information about the
            encrypted data if the attackers can make the user's computer make
            connections to the website. In practice, this turns out to be
            easy. This is now referred to as
            the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRIME_(security_exploit)">CRIME
            attack</a>. While some clients have mitigations in place, it's been
            determined that the best way to avoid the attack is to disable TLS 
            compression entirely. Clients that do so will be defaulted to 
            <span class="label okay">Probably Okay</span> while clients
            that leave it enabled will be marked
            as <span class="label bad">Bad</span>.</p>

          <h4 class="fragpadded" id="beast-vulnerability">BEAST Vulnerability</h4>
          <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#BEAST_attack">BEAST
            vulnerability</a> is an attack on TLS 1.0 connections using a
            cipher suite in a cipher block chaining (CBC) mode. An
            attacker is able
            to <a href="https://vnhacker.blogspot.com/2011/09/beast.html">decrypt
            the data</a> on a TLS connection matching that
            criteria. Upgrading to TLS 1.1 or greater or not using CBC
            cipher suites prevents the attack (though, RC4 has its own
            issues). Another mitigation strategy is called 1/n-1 record
            splitting. 1/n-1 record splitting allows TLS 1.0 clients
            using CBC cipher modes to mitigate the attack by sending only
            a single byte in the first encrypted application data record
            of the connection, which fixes up the initialization vector
            for the rest of the connection.</p>
          <p>A caveat here: Certain TLS libraries, like Java's
            javax.net.ssl, use a slightly different form of 1/n-1 record
            splitting that is not detectable by How's My SSL? as most
            requests to How's My SSL? are too small to trigger
            it. However, these libraries have usually implemented TLS 1.2
            and clients should use it to remove this error.</p>
          <p>If the client supports CBC mode cipher suites on TLS 1.0
            and does not implement the 1/n-1 record splitting mitigation
            detectable by How's My SSL?, it will be marked
            as <span class="label bad">Bad</span>.</p>
          <p>Clients using versions of TLS greater than 1.0 or not using
            CBC cipher suites or are using both but also implement 1/n-1
            record splitting, will be marked as <span class="label
                                                             okay">Probably Okay</span></p>

          <h4 class="fragpadded" id="insecure-cipher-suites">Insecure Cipher Suites</h4>
          <p>This section displayed any cipher suites the client supports that
            are known to be insecure. Insecure cipher suites make it easy for
            attackers to decrypt data on tapped lines, or make it easy for the
            attacker to pretend to be the website, stealing secrets directly
            from the client. Cipher suites are found here for one of many
            reasons. Insecure cipher suites are only a problem if the server
            also supports it. Of course, some of these suites don't require the
            server to prove that they can serve the traffic for the site they
            claim to, making them easy to man-in-the-middle.</p>
          <p> The first among these reasons is if the size of the keys created
            by the cipher suite are too small. Small keys are easier to guess
            (or "brute force"), and there are many cipher suites that have been
            defined with far, far too small keys.</p>
          <p>A cipher suite supported by the client will be put here if it
            does not ensure that the server you connected to was actually for
            the website you wanted. Cipher suites are to do so by inspecting the
            certificate the server sends and verifying it trusts the other
            entities (called "certificate authorities") that have "signed" the
            certificate. This is called the "certificate authority trust model",
            and if this sounds crazy to you on many levels, you are not
            alone. It's currently the best security we have,
            however. <a href="https://tack.io/index.html">TACK</a> is one good
            attempt to, in a backwards compatible way, replace it.</p>
          <p>A cipher suite may also be added if it's a "null cipher suite"
            which is a funny way of saying the cipher does not encrypt the data
            at all. In a truly bizarre set of decisions these were put in the
            SSL/TLS specifications even though offer no privacy or security for
            the user or the web service. These are giant, glowing "rob me" signs
            on the web.</p>
          <p>Finally, a cipher suite can be added here if it is known to be
            obsolete in some way. Currently, some NSS clients (like Firefox)
            will allow for the use of under-specified or broken cipher suites
            that were meant to be killed off after the death of SSLv3 and were
            never really specified well in the first place.</p>
          <p>Any client supporting an insecure cipher suite will be marked as
            <span class="label bad">Bad</span>.</p>

          <h4 class="fragpadded" id="unknown-cipher-suites-supported">Unknown Cipher Suites
            Supported</h4>
          <p>This section notes any cipher suites that How's My SSL did not
            recognize. How's My SSL has a very complete knowledge of cipher
            suites both specified and in use. If a cipher suite is unknown, the
            client is being, well, "interesting", and "interesting" usually
            means broken. Without a specification, a cipher suite has not been
            publicly vetted by the community of cryptographers and the vast,
            vast, vast majority of unvetted security systems are entirely
            insecure. Clients supporting unknown cipher suites will be marked
            as <span class="label bad">Bad</span>.</p>
          
          <h4 class="fragpadded" id="given-cipher-suites">Given Cipher Suites</h4>
          <p>This section is one of the most often needed by developers and was
            the original reason this webapp was made. It simply prints out the
            standard names of the cipher suites that the client says it supports
            in the same order the client gave them to the server. This ordering
            is sometimes used to determine which cipher suite a client prefers,
            but TLS servers tend to choose their own preference of those cipher
            suits. No rating will be given in this section.</p>

          <hr />
          <h3 class="fragpadded" id="tls-vs-ssl">TLS vs SSL</h3>
          <p>Okay, last thing. The jargon around is a little funny, so
            let's be a little more explicit. The 'S' in "HTTPS" is the
            TLS protocol. When folks refer to the
            "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">TLS</a>"
            they are referring to the most common of modern protocols
            of encrypting data across the
            internet. "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSL">SSL</a>",
            when used by experts, refers to the older versions of these
            protocols. In general, people use "SSL" and "TLS"
            interchangeably, but that's changing towards everyone
            saying "TLS". "TLS" is what everyone will call it in the
            future, while "SSL" is the phrase everyone knows right
            now.</p>

          <p>(Heck, at some point, this site will redirect
            to <a href="https://howsmytls.com">howsmytls.com</a> instead
            of it redirecting here.)</p>
